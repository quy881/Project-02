Scripting in Bash

A summary of what I did for this project is located at (username blocked out in images): https://gofile.io/d/pFEpTE

Source: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners

There were at least 2 commands I couldn't use, cal and man. I also didn't experiment much with the backup.sh because I didn't have the exact directories as the tutorial and I need more practice with paths.

I was also under a different username throughout the process which is why I had to block the username out.
